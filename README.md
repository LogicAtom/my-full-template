AK-MS1

This Milestone1 Project is a basic website of my portfolio

UX

I am looking to make the User Experience easy to process and understand, its that simple.



Existing Features

    Feature 1 - allows potential employers to achieve viewing my projects, by having them look through my site.
    


Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

    HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Python3, iframes, responsive coding, form requirements.

    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

Testing

I conducted testing after adding each element and after changing any code, numerous times. Tested on these browers: Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari
On these platforms:  Microsoft Windows, Google Chromebook, Android OS, Iphone OS.

All links have been tested and function, as well as all images, coding, form validation, css, UX, email link.

My UX provides easy navigation, a clean UX design, clean coding, and total functionality.


Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

Scripts were not used in this project, it is total html and css from scratch.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact Us" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

        All user stories have been thoroughly tested and 100% functional.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

This project looks and works on most devices and screen resolutions as well as minimizing and resizing browser windows.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

No bugs found

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

Utilized GitHub Gitpod with extensions provided by Code Institute

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Initially used Repl.it, but considering the project requirments are to use GitHub I moved my basic code over then built upon it.

    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)? No
    Different configuration files? didn't edit any config files
    Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
You can choose Work Offline, and/or save the webpage to your local system for local running, but considering there are web links and image links running locally is not recommended for this project.

END MS1 PROJECT NOTES
*******************************

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!

THANKS BUT I'M GONNA STICK WITH NOT USING GITPOD AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AS IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE YOU EXPLAINED.  :(
